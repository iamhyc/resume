    Edge Computing in Distributed and Cooperation System
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    ***2* published, *0* ongoing, *0* patent.**

    In the published papers, we use POMDP to formulate a cooperative distributed job dispatching problem in an edge computing system.
    We propose an efficient and performance-guaranteed distributed solution framework, which is scalable to the size of the edge computing system.

    Online Semi-supervised Federated Learning on High-fidelity Simulators
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    ***2* published, *1* ongoing, *0* patent.**

    In the published papers, we formulate a *semi-supervised federated learning problem* where multiple vehicles are equipped with a [SECOND network](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5125/a16039cabc6320c908a4764f32596e018ad3.pdf) for 3D object detection.
    Firstly, the vehicles would locally infer the objects with a pre-trained model.
    Then the information of all the inferred objects is uploaded for global fusion.
    Finally, the vehicles get the distributed global objects list, and try to improve the local network with the previous samples. 
    We implemented the experiment based on a high-fidelity autonomous driving simulator [CARLA](https://carla.org/), and generated some datasets conformed to the [KITTI dataset format](http://www.cvlibs.net/datasets/kitti/).
    The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/lasso-sustech/CARLA_INVS).

    In the ongoing paper, we formulate a resource allocation problem in the above scenario, to achieve both energy and latency efficiency in online federated training.
    We note that the randomness of vehicles' locations would affect both allocation of communication and computation power. Moreover, the sharing of wireless resources further increases the complexity of solution.

    VLC Platform over NI Instruments and Out-of-shelf Wi-Fi NIC
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
    ***0* published, *0* ongoing, *1* patent.**

    In this project, we implemented a hybrid VLC-WiFi communication system, where the VLC link bears the high-throughput downlink, and Wi-Fi link servers as uplink.
    We implemented the system on NI instruments with out-of-shelf Wi-Fi NIC, and the retransmission mechanism is implemented on IP layer.
    The source code of the whole workable system implementation is provided [here](https://github.com/iamhyc/CSDS-VLC-TCP).
    The granted patent is [数据传输方法、装置、设备及存储介质(CN110429979B)](http://epub.cnipa.gov.cn/patentdetail.action).
