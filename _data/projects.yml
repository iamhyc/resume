#     This project is aiming at providing quick root-tree based network topology generating in `ns3`.

#     It's writing in CPP to to keep native and efficiency with ns3. The network topology could be simply described in JSON format, which is naturally tree-based, and describe the test procedures in the same json file.

#     It also provides lot of utilities together for quick network physical link and routing definition. You could feel easy to add your own definition following the conduct of code.

    This project implements an in-stack network data encryption trial based on **Linux Netfilter subsystem**.
    It uses asynchronous encryption method `AES-128` provided by kernel function, to encrypt the *payload of L3* (i.e., content of an IP packet) and decrypt it correspondingly at the receiver's side.

    In the possible future work, this project would be extended with an identification mechanism which allows the tx/rx to negotiate the enable of en(de)cryption, and a userspace tool based on **Linux Netlink subsystem** for key management.

    This project aims at providing the fastest access to the wireless NIC driver from userspace (the most recommended NIC for now is the `intel 8260/9260` series).

    In fact, Linux mac80211 subsystem provides a set of APIs to monitor and modify the parameters related to IEEE 802.11 MAC design.
    However, the existing tools rely on either `ioctl` or `genl` which could not provide real-time and robust access to kernel driver.
    In this project, we design one kernel module to hijack the function entry of the driver, and use `mmap` to establish a shared-memory communication between kernel and userspace.
    The experiment results show that we could alter a set of parameters (related to channel access priority) **within 10 millisecond for 1000 accesses**.
